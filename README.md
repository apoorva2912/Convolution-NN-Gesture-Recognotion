# Convolution-NN-Gesture-Recognition

Project Implements three different CNN namely AlexNet, ResNet and MobileNet for Gesture Recognition. 
Dataset has 5,243 images and ten classes of hand gestures. Implemented using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, pandas etc.
Conducted an extensive comparative analysis of three CNN models (AlexNet, ResNet50, MobileNet) for Gesture Recognition across various metrics, including training loss, training accuracy, and training time,
Determined that MobileNet exhibited the most consistent performance with training accuracy of  99% and training time of 2044 secs which is the least among three, making it the preferred model for the application.
